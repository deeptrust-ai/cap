## Command Line Formatting

The new command line rules say that your cap or not requests must first tag the bot, and then add the `capType` right after. The `capType` is strictly the strings `deepfake` or `factcheck` to do one of two possible AI-detection jobs.

`@capornot_` `capType` `say anything you want after`

### Examples

```
Correct: "@capornot_ deepfake"

Incorrect: "yo check this deepfake out @capornot_"
```

```
Correct: "@capornot_ factcheck"

Incorrect: "factcheck @capornot_"
```
